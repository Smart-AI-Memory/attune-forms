"""Local-only log of form-surface routing decisions.

The decay guard for D21 (round table ``q-forms-default-vs-latency-001``,
Claude seat): flipping the default to the rich widget is only worth
something if the behaviour actually changes, so record what
:func:`attune.elicitation.select_form_surface` decided and let a later
read answer "did the mix move?" instead of assuming it did.

One event = one JSON line: ``v`` / ``ts`` / ``event`` / ``surface``
plus optional routing context.

**What this can and cannot measure.** The live call site is the pair of
MCP elicitation handlers, where the tool the agent invoked *is* its
choice — so each record carries the router's recommendation (``surface``
/ ``reason``), what the agent actually did (``chosen``), and whether
they matched (``agreed``). That makes disagreement visible, not just
volume.

It still does NOT see a raw ``AskUserQuestion`` turn the agent wrote by
hand without building a ``FormSchema`` at all — that path never enters
Python. So the forms-vs-no-form ratio remains only partially observable
from here, and the missing half has to come from transcript inspection.
What *is* now observable is the narrower and more actionable signal:
when a form was built and the agent then flattened it anyway.

Consent model matches :mod:`attune.telemetry.memory_events`: LOCAL
recording is default-on and nothing ever leaves the machine.
``DO_NOT_TRACK`` or ``ATTUNE_FORM_TELEMETRY=0`` disables the log.
Never raises — routing must not fail because telemetry did.
