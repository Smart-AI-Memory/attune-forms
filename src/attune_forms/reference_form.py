"""Canonical reference form exercising every elicitation control type.

This module is the single, code-verified example of a *complete*
declarative form: one field per :class:`~attune.meta_workflows.models.QuestionType`
member, each with realistic example values, plus a matching set of valid
answers. It is deliberately a plain data constant — importable and
copy-from-able — not a template-store entry or a ``form_from_template``
invocation. The V7 template library (:mod:`.template_store`) exists, but
per its promote-on-repeat rule (R5) only *recurring* fork classes earn a
stored template; this reference is documentation, not a recurring ask,
so it stays a constant.

The paired :data:`REFERENCE_FORM` / :data:`EXAMPLE_ANSWERS` round-trip
through the existing seams with no changes:

    >>> from attune_forms import form_from_dict, collect_form_response
    >>> form = form_from_dict(REFERENCE_FORM)
    >>> response = collect_form_response(form, EXAMPLE_ANSWERS)
    >>> response.responses["priority"]
    'high'

``tests/unit/elicitation/test_reference_form.py`` asserts the form stays
complete: if a new ``QuestionType`` is added without a field here, CI
fails — the reference cannot silently fall behind the grammar.
