"""Tests for inference-first forms — prefilled values marked as guesses.

The premise: ceremony isn't caused by forms being rich, it's caused by
being asked things you already answered. A form that arrives with fields
filled in from context turns a three-dimension ask into a confirmation.

The risk that creates is the opposite one — a wrong guess accepted
because it looked settled. So the guarantees under test are:

1. An inferred value is always VISIBLY a guess, on every surface.
2. A fully-inferred form is still RENDERED (as a confirmation), never
   silently skipped — chair-ruled 2026-07-25.
3. An inference without a value is a definition error, so a "guessed"
   badge can never appear over an empty control.
