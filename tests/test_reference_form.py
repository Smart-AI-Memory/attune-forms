"""Tests for the canonical all-controls reference form.

Guards two invariants:

1. **Completeness** — the reference exercises *every* ``QuestionType``.
   If a new control type is added to the grammar without a field in
   ``REFERENCE_FORM``, ``test_reference_covers_every_control_type``
   fails, so the reference cannot silently fall behind.
2. **Round-trip** — the reference plus its example answers validate
   through the real ``form_from_dict`` → ``collect_form_response`` seams
   (no mocks), and a missing required answer is rejected (R4).
